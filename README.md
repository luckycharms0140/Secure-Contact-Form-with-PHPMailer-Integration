# Secure Contact Form with PHPMailer Integration
This project is a contact form implementation that securely sends user-submitted data via email using PHP and PHPMailer. The project includes an HTML form and a PHP script to handle the form submission, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality through several security measures.

HTML Form Interaction
The HTML form allows users to input their name, email, and message. Upon submission, the form data is sent to the PHP script via the POST method. The PHP script processes this data and sends it as an email to a specified recipient.

Security Measures
Honeypot Field:

Protection: Helps to prevent automated bot submissions.
Implementation: A hidden honeypot field is added to the form. Real users will not see this field and will leave it empty, whereas bots, which often fill out all fields, will fill this field, thus identifying themselves.
Google reCAPTCHA:

Protection: Ensures that the form is submitted by a human and not a bot.
Implementation: The form integrates Google reCAPTCHA, requiring users to complete a CAPTCHA challenge before submitting the form. This reduces the risk of automated bot submissions.
Data Sanitization and Validation:

Protection: Prevents malicious code injection and ensures data integrity.
Implementation: User inputs are sanitized and validated. The email address is sanitized using FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL and validated using FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL. Other inputs are sanitized using htmlspecialchars to escape special characters, preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
Using PHPMailer for Secure Email Sending:

Protection: Ensures secure email transmission.
Implementation: PHPMailer is configured to use secure SMTP connections with STARTTLS encryption, ensuring that emails are sent securely.
SSL/TLS Configuration:

Protection: Enhances the security of the SMTP connection.
Implementation: SSL/TLS options are set to verify the peer and peer name, and to use a CA certificate file. This ensures the authenticity of the SMTP server and encrypts the connection.
Error Handling:

Protection: Provides user-friendly error messages and handles exceptions gracefully.
Implementation: The script uses try-catch blocks to handle exceptions. User-friendly alerts are shown for both successful email sending and errors.
Preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

Protection: Prevents the execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser.
Implementation: User inputs are sanitized using htmlspecialchars, which converts special characters to HTML entities, preventing script execution.
Preventing Email Header Injection:

Protection: Prevents attackers from injecting additional email headers.
Implementation: PHPMailer handles email headers securely, mitigating the risk of header injection attacks.
HTTPS:

Protection: Encrypts data in transit between the user's browser and the server.
Implementation: The website should be served over HTTPS. An SSL certificate should be obtained and installed to ensure encrypted communication.
Security Issues Addressed
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):

Issue: XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users.
Solution: Sanitizing user inputs with htmlspecialchars to prevent the execution of injected scripts.
Email Header Injection:

Issue: This occurs when an attacker injects malicious email headers to manipulate email delivery.
Solution: Using PHPMailer, which securely handles email headers and prevents injection attacks.
Insecure Data Transmission:

Issue: Data sent over an unencrypted connection can be intercepted by attackers.
Solution: Using STARTTLS encryption for SMTP and serving the website over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
Invalid Data Submission:

Issue: Unvalidated user input can lead to data integrity issues and security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Validating and sanitizing user inputs to ensure they meet the expected format and content.

Setup Instructions!!!!!
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git

Download PHPMailer: Download the latest release of PHPMailer from the PHPMailer GitHub page, extract the ZIP file, and move the src folder to your project directory under a new folder named PHPMailer.

Upload Files to Your Server: Upload the necessary files and directories (contact.html, send_email.php, PHPMailer directory, and cacert.pem file) to your web server's public_html directory (or the root directory of your website).

Edit send_email.php with Your Details: Open send_email.php in a text editor and replace the placeholders with your specific details:

'your_smtp_server': Your SMTP server address.
'your_email@example.com': Your email account.
'your_password': Your email account password.
'/path/to/cacert.pem': The path to the cacert.pem file on your server.
'Your Name or Business': The name you want to appear as the sender.
'recipient_email@example.com': The email address where you want to receive the contact form submissions.
'your_site_key': The site key provided by Google reCAPTCHA.
'your_secret_key': The secret key provided by Google reCAPTCHA.
Ensure Your Server Supports SMTP: Verify that your server supports SMTP connections and that the necessary ports (usually 587 for STARTTLS or 465 for SSL) are open.

Test the Contact Form: Navigate to your contact form page in your web browser, fill out the form, and submit it. Check the inbox of the recipient email address to verify that the email was received.

Enable HTTPS on Your Website: Ensure your website uses HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your server. Obtain and install an SSL certificate if you havenâ€™t already.

By following these steps, you can implement a secure and reliable contact form on your website. The form leverages a combination of honeypot fields, Google reCAPTCHA, input sanitization, and secure SMTP configuration to protect against spam and ensure data security.
