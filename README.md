# Secure-Contact-Form-with-PHPMailer-Integration
This project includes an HTML contact form and a PHP script that securely sends form submissions via email using PHPMailer. Security measures include input sanitization, validation to prevent XSS and email header injection, STARTTLS for encrypted SMTP, SSL/TLS verification, and HTTPS for secure data transmission.
